INTRODUCTION
=============

Big Data is a phrase used to mean a massive volume of both structured and unstructured data that is so large it is difficult to process using traditional
database and software techniques. In most enterprise scenarios the volume of data is too big or it moves too fast or it exceeds current processing capacity.
The project to be done is a batch data project.Cloudera quickstart VM is used in this batch data project.


OBJECTIVE
=========

To store Big data in hdfs and process that Big data using pyspark to obtain the necessary information for the user.


PROCEDURE
==========

1)Download the necessary data from Kaggle.com.The data I have taken is nba_stats which is uploaded in the Raw data folder of this file.

2)Use the command "mysql -u root -p" and type the password "cloudera" to enter MySQL.

3)Create a database in MySQL using the command "CREATE DATABASE project;" and give "use project" to access that database.

4)Create a table with the right column names and data types in 	MySQL so that the obtained data can be loaded into it.

5)The code for creating a table is given in the folder Program code

6)Load the obtained data in MySQL.The code for loading the data is given in the folder Program code.

7)The loaded table in MySQL is imported in hive using sqoop.The code for importing the data using sqoop is given in the folder Program code.

8)Use command "hive" to enter hive and check whether the data is properly imported use the code "Select * from nbahive;" to check the imported data.

9)Create a directory in linux using "mkdir project".Use "vi project.py" to open a Python script file to process the nba data that was imported in hive.

10)The code for processing the data to obtain the required information is given in the folder Python code.

11)Use "spark-submit project.py" to run the python file containing the code.

12)The screenshots of the outputs is in the folder Screenshots/Output.

13)Open HUE which is located in the browser and click impala/hive to view the result tables.Right click the table and select open in editor.

14)Different visualization options are given in HUE such as bar diagram,Pie chart,Line chart,etc click the required chart to visualize your result table.

15)The screenshots of the charts/diagrams in HUE is given in folder Screenshots/Chart

16)The Architecture diagram of this project is located in the folder Architecture Diagram


Conclusion
============

If all the above steps are correctly followed the big data is stored and processed and the required information/date that is necessary for the
user is obtained.
